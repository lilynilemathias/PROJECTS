1. The WDI program should be 16 weeks instead of 12 weeks.
  The extra four weeks would allow for a more reasonable pace and give some
  students who are very new to programming a chance to stay on track and learn at their pace.

2. Solutions for homework should be posted the following day.
Even if there is no time to review them during class it would be helpful
to have them in the class github repo so the students could review independently and
prepare questions. Sometimes people don't ask questions because they don't know what
answers to ask.

3. On the first day of class, have readme.md in the class github repo on
students tips and best practices for approaching the homework.

4. I think the smaller breakout classes are amazing! Please
keep those up as much as possible.
